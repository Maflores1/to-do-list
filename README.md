# To-Do List Program

A simple Python-based To-Do list application that allows users to manage tasks with features such as task completion, task categorization, filtering, and persistent storage across sessions using a JSON file.

## Features

- **View Tasks**: Display all tasks in the list.
- **Add a Task**: Add a new task to the list with a description and category.
- **Remove a Task**: Remove a task from the list by selecting its number.
- **Mark a Task as Completed**: Mark a task as completed instead of deleting it.
- **View Completed Tasks**: View tasks that are marked as completed.
- **Filter Tasks by Category**: View tasks filtered by category (e.g., Work, Personal).
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved to and loaded from a JSON file, so your to-do list is maintained across different sessions.
